# Advent of Code Challenges

This is a repository for my solutions to the [Advent of Code Challenges](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Directories

Each directory is a year containing the files:

-YYYYChallengeInputN.txt
-AOCYYY_N.py

Where YYYY is the challenge year and N is the challenge number. Parts 1 and 2 are completed in the same file.
